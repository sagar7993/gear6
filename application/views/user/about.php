			<div class="col s12">
			
				In today’s busy world people want to save their time and energy for themselves so that they could invest the same in other productive work. 
				So is it common that our bikes are not given the attention they need (repair/service/maintenance etc). 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Personally, we faced this problem and felt this is ‘the need’ of the hour. Issues like, hectic work hours, difficulty in locating nearby 
				service centers, sudden breakdown in traffic are faced by many people. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				We, the gear6.in team have determined to make bike maintenance easy through an online platform. We bring all service centers(authorized) under 
				a virtual roof, enabling customers to pick from the best service centers. The idea is to reduce the waiting time in the service centers and 
				provide a hassle free service booking, management and maintenance of bikes for people. 
			
			</div>
			<br/>
				<br/>
			<div class="col s12"><h5>What We Do?</h5></div><hr>
			<div class="col s12">
			
				We provide an online platform with info of all the authorized bike service centers and enable the users to book a service online. 
				We want to make sure, your bike is always in a good condition and available as your first choice of transport. After all, who doesn’t love bikes? :) 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				We provide booking for not just repair, but also, periodic servicing,emergency service, insurance renewal, query, punctures and much more. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				We provide services like, home pickup and drop off of your vehicle, guide you to the nearest service center when your bike breaks down,
				 directing to nearest petrol station when you need fuel, guide you to the nearest puc center for pollution check, sms and email tracking of 
				 your service order and many more.

			<div class="col s12"><h5>Team</h5></div><hr>
			<div class="col s12">
			
				We are a young team from BITS Pilani, set out on a revolutioniary challenge, to bring automobile services to an online platform.
				On stepping into it, we worked with passion and persistence, where everyone in the team is a hands-on contributor. 
				In this journey, we shared our ideas, improved ourselves,learnt from our mistakes and worked with excitement.
