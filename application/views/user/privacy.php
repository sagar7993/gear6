					Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Policy in order

					for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of 

					personal information.The following outlines our privacy policy.<br/> <br/>

					Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we will identify the purposes for 

					which information is being collected.<br/> <br/>

					When you use our Website, we store your browsing information. Our primary goal in 

					doing so is to provide you a safe, efficient, smooth and customized experience. This 

					allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to 

					customize our Website to make your experience safer and easier. More importantly, 

					while doing so we collect personal information from you that we consider necessary for 

					achieving this purpose.<br/> <br/>

					We will collect and use personal information solely with the objective of fulfilling those 

					purposes specified by us and for other compatible purposes, unless we obtain the 

					consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.<br/> <br/>

					We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, 

					with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned.<br/> <br/>

					We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Website to 

					help analyze our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust 

					and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing 

					our services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a 

					"cookie".<br/> <br/>

					Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of 

					the Website that are placed by third parties. We do not control the use of cookies by 

					third parties.<br/> <br/>

					online payment.<br/> <br/>
